MongoLab Surveyor for WP8
=
MongoLab Surveyor is a simple application that allows to query storage statistics 
for all MongoDB database instances in a MongoLab account. MongoLab Surveyor must 
pass an API Key as query parameter. To obtain your API key, log in to your MongoLab 
account and click on your username in the upper right-hand corner next to the
"user:" label. This will lead you to the user admin page where you will see a 
section titled "API Key". If you want to update the current key, click the 
"Regenerate API key" button. The API Key is saved in the device's local storage
and is used only for quering purposes.
